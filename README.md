Filewatcher
===========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/judofyr/temple.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/judofyr/temple) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/judofyr/temple.png?travis)](https://gemnasium.com/judofyr/temple) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/judofyr/temple.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/judofyr/temple)

Lightweight filewatcher weighing less than 90 LoC. No dependencies or platform specific code.
Works everywhere. Monitors changes in the filesystem by polling.

Install
-------

Needs Ruby and Rubygems:

    $ [sudo] gem install filewatcher

Command line utility
--------------------

Filewatcher scans the filesystem and execute shell commands when files are
changed.

    Usage:
        filewatcher [-i interval] "<filename>" "<shell command>"

    Where
        filename: filename(s) to scan.
        shell command: shell command to execute when a file is changed

Examples
--------

Run the echo command when the file myfile is changed:

    $ filewatcher "myfile" "echo 'myfile has changed'"

Run any javascript in the current directory when it is updated in Windows
Powershell:

    > filewatcher *.js "node %FILENAME%"

In Linux/OSX:

    $ filewatcher *.js 'node $FILENAME'

Place filenames or filenames in quotes to use ruby filename globbing instead
of shell filename globbing. This will make filewatcher look for files in
subdirectories too.

    > filewatcher "*.js" "node %FILENAME%"

In Linux/OSX:

    > filewatcher '*.js' 'node $FILENAME'

Try to run the updated file as a script when it is updated by using the
--exec/-e option. Works with files with file extensions that looks like a
python, ruby, perl, php, javascript or awk script.

    $ filewatcher -e *.rb

Print a list of all files matching *.css first and then output the filename
when a file is beeing updated by using the --list/-l option:

    $ filewatcher -l *.css 'echo file: $FILENAME'

Watch the "src" and "test" folders recursively, and run test when the
filesystem gets updated:

    $ filewatcher "src test" "ruby test/test_suite.rb"

Available enviroment variables
------------------------------

The environment variable $FILENAME is available in the shell command argument.
On unix like systems the command has to be enclosed in single quotes. To run
node whenever a javascript file is updated:

    $ filewatcher *.js 'node $FILENAME'

The environment variables $FILEPATH, $FILEDIR and $FSEVENT is also available.

Command line options
--------------------

    --interval, -i <f>:   Interval in seconds to scan filesystem. Defaults to 0.5 seconds.
            --exec, -e:   Execute file as a script when file is updated.
     --recurse, -r <s>:   Recurse into the directory, watching everything matching 'expression'
     --include, -n <s>:   Include files (default: *)
     --exclude, -x <s>:   Exclude file(s) matching (default: "")
            --list, -l:   Print name of files being watched
         --version, -v:   Print version and exit
            --help, -h:   Show this message

Ruby API
--------

Watch a list of files and directories:

    require 'filewatcher'

    FileWatcher.new(["lib/", "Rakefile"]).watch do |filename|
      puts "Updated " + filename
    end

To detect if a file is updated, added or deleted:

    FileWatcher.new(["README.rdoc"]).watch() do |filename, event|
      if(event == :changed)
        puts "File updated: " + filename
      end
      if(event == :delete)
        puts "File deleted: " + filename
      end
      if(event == :new)
        puts "Added file: " + filename
      end
    end

To check for changes more often than the default once every second:

    FileWatcher.new(["README.rdoc"]).watch(0.5) do |filename|
      puts "Updated " + filename
    end

Print the names of the files found before watching files and folders:

    FileWatcher.new(["lib/"],true).watch do |filename|
      puts "Updated " + filename
    end
    => Watching files:
    lib/filewatcher.rb

Use patterns to match filenames in current directory and subdirectories. The
pattern is not a regular expression; instead it follows rules similar to shell
filename globbing. Se Ruby
[documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch)
for syntax.

    FileWatcher.new(["*.rb", "*.xml"]).watch do |filename|
      puts "Updated " + filename
    end

The filewatcher library is just a single file with 96 LOC (including comments)
with no dependencies.

TODO
----

Use thor in the command line utility.
The Ruby API is fairly well tested but the command line program has been
buggy.

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

*   Fork the project.
*   Make your feature addition or bug fix.
*   Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
*   Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
*   Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
